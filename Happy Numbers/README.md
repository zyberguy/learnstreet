Welcome! Here is a Happy Numbers project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using python.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

A happy number is defined by the following process -Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle (with repeating numbers) which does not include 1.<br> Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. <br>Your task is to write the code for a function which determines whether an input number is Happy or Unhappy.

Try it out!
