Welcome! Here is a Income Tax Calculator project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using python.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

In this exercise, you will read a bunch of salaries from a textbox, perform a tax calculation on them and then display the result in a table format. <br>
<br>
We will write 2 functions calculateTax() which will calculate tax given an income, and incomeList() which will read a series of numbers from a textbox and print their income taxes.<br>
<br>
As a first step, we could construct a tax rule as follows:<br>
<br><code>
Incomes uptill 10,000 are not taxed at all.<br>
Income in between 10,000 to 20,000 are taxed at 10%<br>
Income in between 20,000 to 40,000 are taxed at 20%<br>
Income above 40,000 are taxed at 30%.</code><br>

Try it out!
