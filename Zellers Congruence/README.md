Welcome! Here is a Zellers Congruence project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using python.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

Write a method that determines the day of the week for any given calendar date. Code it and share it with your friends to find out what day of the week your born, you got married or anything else you can think of!

Try it out!
